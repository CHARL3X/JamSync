## PHASE 1: CORE MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE (HIGH PRIORITY)

### 1.1 Tempo Detection & Beat Alignment
- [ ] **Implement real-time tempo detection**
  - Add Web Audio API tempo detection using autocorrelation
  - Track BPM over 4-second rolling window
  - Filter out false positives (speech, noise)
  - Display detected tempo in UI

- [ ] **Beat-aligned latency synchronization**
  - Calculate optimal delay as multiple of beat duration
  - Formula: `alignedDelay = Math.ceil(networkLatency / beatDuration) * beatDuration`
  - Auto-suggest beat-aligned buffers
  - Show musical vs. network timing in stats

- [ ] **Musical sync quality scoring**
  - Score based on timing drift from beat grid
  - Factor in tempo consistency between players
  - Display as "Musical Sync" percentage
  - Color-code: Green (>90%), Yellow (70-90%), Red (<70%)

### 1.2 Visual Timing System
- [ ] **Implement visual metronome**
  - Pulsing circle synchronized to detected/set tempo
  - Beat counter (1-2-3-4) with time signature support
  - Configurable subdivision display (quarter, eighth notes)
  - Sync visual beats to audio buffer timing

- [ ] **Haptic feedback integration**
  - Use Web Vibration API for mobile devices
  - Vibrate on strong beats (1 and 3 in 4/4)
  - Configurable intensity and pattern
  - Battery-conscious implementation

- [ ] **Timing cue system**
  - Visual countdown for phrase starts
  - "Next section" alerts based on musical structure
  - Color-coded timing quality indicators
  - Adaptive cues based on detected musical style

  - Smart packet loss recovery using musical context

- [ ] **Connection quality assessment**
  - Score network fitness for different musical styles
  - Recommend collaboration modes based on connection
  - Show optimal time windows for jamming
  - Suggest alternative approaches when network poor

## PHASE 3: COMMUNITY & SOCIAL FEATURES (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### 3.1 Real-time Communication
- [ ] **Integrated chat system**
  - Low-latency text messaging during sessions
  - Quick preset messages ("wait", "again", "good!")
  - Emoji reactions with musical context
  - Message history persistence

- [ ] **Non-verbal communication**
  - Visual hand signals/cues
  - Shared chord charts with live annotations
  - Set lists with current position tracking
  - "Ready" status indicators

### 3.2 Session Management
- [ ] **Session recording & playback**
  - Record individual and mixed tracks
  - Timestamp musical events and chat
  - Export to standard formats (WAV, MIDI)
  - Share recordings with session participants

- [ ] **Collaboration history**
  - Track past sessions with partners
  - Save preferred settings per collaboration pair
  - Musical compatibility scoring
  - Improvement tracking over time

---

## PHASE 4: ADVANCED MUSICAL FEATURES (LOW PRIORITY)

### 4.1 AI-Enhanced Collaboration
- [ ] **Predictive audio streaming**
  - ML model trained on musical patterns
  - Stream probable next notes 100-200ms ahead
  - Confidence-based mixing with actual audio
  - Fallback gracefully on prediction errors

- [ ] **Musical intelligence assistant**
  - Suggest chord progressions during pauses
  - Recommend tempo/key changes for sync improvement
  - Detect and highlight timing improvement opportunities
  - Provide post-session analysis and tips

### 4.2 Educational Integration
- [ ] **Learning mode features**
  - Tempo training exercises with partner
  - Sync accuracy scoring and feedback
  - Progressive difficulty levels
  - Integration with music education curricula

- [ ] **Accessibility enhancements**
  - Visual timing for hearing-impaired musicians
  - Simplified interfaces for different skill levels
  - Alternative input methods (MIDI, guitar-to-MIDI)
  - Customizable UI complexity

---

## PHASE 5: ECOSYSTEM INTEGRATION (FUTURE)

### 5.1 Platform Connectivity
- [ ] **DAW integration**
  - Plugin versions for major DAWs
  - MIDI sync with external sequencers
  - Audio routing to/from recording software
  - Project file sharing and collaboration

- [ ] **Music platform integration**
  - Export directly to YouTube, SoundCloud
  - Integration with notation software
  - Collaborative playlists and setlists
  - Social sharing of successful sessions

### 5.2 Hardware Optimization
- [ ] **Audio interface support**
  - Detect and optimize for professional interfaces
  - Support for ASIO/Core Audio low-latency drivers
  - Hardware monitoring integration
  - Multi-channel support for bands

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### New Classes to Implement
```javascript
class TempoDetector { /* Real-time BPM analysis */ }
class MusicalSyncEngine { /* Beat-aligned timing */ }
class CollaborationModeManager { /* Smart mode switching */ }
class VisualTimingSystem { /* Metronome and cues */ }
class ChatManager { /* Real-time messaging */ }
class SessionRecorder { /* Multi-track recording */ }
class PredictiveAudioEngine { /* AI-enhanced streaming */ }
```

### Integration Points
- Extend existing `SyncJamEngine` class
- Add new UI sections without breaking current layout
- Maintain backward compatibility with basic usage
- Progressive enhancement approach

## RISK MITIGATION

### Technical Risks
- **Tempo detection accuracy**: Implement multiple algorithms, user override
- **Predictive streaming latency**: Graceful fallback to standard streaming
- **Browser compatibility**: Progressive enhancement, feature detection

### User Experience Risks
- **Complexity overload**: Hide advanced features behind "Advanced" toggle
- **Learning curve**: Guided onboarding, contextual help
- **Performance impact**: Lazy loading, optional features

### Business Risks
- **Feature creep**: Stick to core musical value proposition
- **Development time**: Implement in phases, validate each step
- **User adoption**: A/B testing, gradual rollout
